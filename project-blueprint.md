## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Project Scope Analysis
Parse the `<prompt-context>` to understand:
- Project type and primary use case
- Target users and scale requirements
- Key features and functionality
- Success metrics and business goals
- Constraints (timeline, budget, team, technical)

If `--rehydrate-from` provided:
- Load previous project analysis
- Identify reusable components and patterns
- Adapt timeline and approach based on similarities

### Step 2: Technology Foundation
Either reuse from rehydration source or invoke supporting prompts:
- Technology stack recommendation (via stack-recommendation prompt)
- Platform constraints analysis (via platform-constraints prompt)
- Architecture patterns from similar projects

### Step 3: Phase Definition
Structure project into logical phases:

**Phase 0**: Foundation (tooling, environment, CI/CD)
**Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure (auth, database, APIs)  
**Phase 2**: MVP Features (core user workflows)
**Phase 3**: Polish & Launch (performance, monitoring, production)
**Phase N+**: Post-launch iterations

Each phase includes:
- Clear objectives and deliverables
- Success criteria for completion
- Dependencies on previous phases
- Risk assessment and mitigation

### Step 4: Task Breakdown
For each phase, create detailed tasks:
- Specific, actionable work items
- Effort estimates in hours/days
- Skill requirements and assignee types
- Dependencies and acceptance criteria
- Testing and validation approaches

### Step 5: Risk Assessment
Identify project risks across categories:

**Technical Risks**: Integration complexity, performance challenges, technology learning curves
**Project Risks**: Timeline pressures, team availability, requirement changes
**Business Risks**: Market timing, user adoption, competitive threats

For each risk, define:
- Probability and impact assessment
- Mitigation strategies to reduce likelihood
- Contingency plans if risks materialize
- Early warning indicators

### Step 6: Team and Resource Planning
Recommend ideal team composition:
- Required roles and responsibilities
- Skill requirements for each role
- Training needs for new technologies
- Team scaling throughout project phases

### Step 7: Quality and Deployment Strategy
Define approaches for:
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Code quality and review processes
- Deployment automation and environments
- Monitoring and observability

### Step 8: Evidence-Based Validation
Research similar projects for lessons learned:
- GitHub repositories with similar scope
- Blog posts about project implementations
- Case studies and post-mortems
- Industry best practices and anti-patterns

## Quality Gates

Before returning results, validate:
- âœ… Clear phase breakdown with dependencies
- âœ… Detailed tasks with effort estimates
- âœ… Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- âœ… Team composition recommendations
- âœ… Technology choices justified with evidence
- âœ… Success metrics defined and measurable
- âœ… Budget and timeline estimates provided

## Example Usage

### Basic Project Planning
```
Ask prompter to run project-blueprint with context: "Build a collaborative document editor for remote teams with real-time sync and version history"
```

### With Constraints
```
Ask prompter to run project-blueprint with context: "Create a mobile expense tracking app" and constraints: "6 month timeline, 2 person team, iOS first"
```

### With Rehydration
```
Ask prompter to run project-blueprint with context: "Build a task management SaaS" and rehydration from ./previous-analysis/project-management-app.yaml
```

## Integration with Other Prompts

This prompt orchestrates other prompts:
- `stack-recommendation`: For technology decisions (Phase 1)
- `platform-constraints`: For implementation guidance (Phase 2)
- `architecture-design`: For system design (Phase 1)
- `migration-strategy`: If replacing existing system

Output becomes input for:
- Task management systems (import detailed tasks)
- Project planning tools (timeline and dependencies)
- Team planning (skill requirements and roles)

## Caching and Reuse

Results cached based on:
- Project type and complexity similarity
- Technology stack overlap
- Team size and timeline similarity

Cache expiration:
- 60 days for stable project types
- 30 days for emerging project patterns
- Invalidated when major technology ecosystem changes occur
